NOTE: In the age of interconnected devices, Shodan, a powerful search engine, has emerged 
as a double-edged sword for SCADA systems. On one hand, it serves as a critical tool for 
cybersecurity researchers and administrators to identify exposed or improperly configured SCADA systems, 
shedding light on potential vulnerabilities. This enables security experts to study and understand the security 
landscape of SCADA ecosystems, ultimately leading to improved practices and heightened awareness among system operators. 
However, we must tread cautiously. Actively searching for SCADA systems can attract unwanted attention, inviting 
both ethical and legal concerns. Unauthorized access or testing of critical infrastructure can open the door to malicious threats. 
As we leverage the power of Shodan to unveil SCADA vulnerabilities, it is vital that we embrace responsible practices and prioritize 
the implementation of robust security measures to safeguard our critical infrastructure from potential risks.
